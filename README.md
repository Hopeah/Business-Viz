## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white)

## Optimizations

To take this project to the next level, I would like to make it a fully personalized application, where each user can generate their own business card with customizable color palettes.

## Lessons Learned:

The main takeaways here are 1) background-image: linear gradient is a very cool property and 2) it's best to not forget that a component can only take in only one element (which thankfully can have nested children elements (: ).
